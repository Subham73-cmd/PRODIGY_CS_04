Simple Keylogger
Here's a basic keylogger program in Python. This program uses the pynput library to monitor keystrokes and save them to a log file. First, make sure you have the pynput library installed. You can install it using pip.You can do this by running the following command in your terminal of VS Code:

'pip install pynput'

After installing the library, you can run the code. It will start recording your keystrokes and saving them to a file named 'keylog.txt' in the same directory as your Python script.
